# dwm - Dynamic Window Manager
My fork of dwm (suckless's dynamic window manager) with patches for my convenience.\

## Patches applied

+ attachasideandbelow
+ bar height
+ barpadding
+ centretitle
+ colorbar
+ fakefullscreen
+ fixborders
+ pertag
+ systray
+ tilegap
+ underlinetags

## Note
Each patch is in its own branch. The branch called custom has everything merged. \
\
While the patches are applied, no configuration has beed done other than what the patches have changed in the config.def.h. \
\
The custom branch is like a vanilla dwm with vanilla patches done with zero configuration. \
Patches applied in the custom branch :

The branch called custom-config is the custom branch some changes in config.def.h to suit my needs.
